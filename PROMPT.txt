Do not go to crazy on the files changed. Prefer generally smaller increments
over large changes. Do it in smaller steps.

Add documentation (on functions, etc.), but do not be verbose. Be short, and
concise.

Do not add fluff stuff.

Regarding code style:
- Do not use abbreviations.
- Always remove trailing spaces.


Always ensure that the project can be built when you are done.

Generally ignore the TODO.txt file. The only time you can alter it is to remove a TODO that
has been done. Never implement anything from without explicit instructions.
