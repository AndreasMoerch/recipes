Do not go to crazy on the files changed. Prefer generally smaller increments
over large changes. Do it in smaller steps.

Add documentation (on functions, etc.), but do not be verbose. Be short, and
concise.

Do not add fluff stuff. Do add the feature throughout, but don't add extra stuff to it.

Regarding code style:
- Do not use abbreviations.
- Always remove trailing spaces.
